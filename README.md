# Data-Driven-Car-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing car market data and building a data-driven system to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and engine specifications.
The goal is to combine data analysis, SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI to deliver actionable insights and accurate price predictions.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data handling to visualization and predictive modeling.

🎯 Objectives
